    <h2>Why Chusme?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Facebook deletes groups with no warning</li>
      <li>Slack is built for companies, not communities</li>
      <li>WhatsApp floods conversations with no structure</li>
      <li>Surveillance platforms monetize every message</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Chusme is different.</strong><br>We give you control, privacy, and a community fund you govern together.</p>
