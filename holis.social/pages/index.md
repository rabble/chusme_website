# Organize your community. On your terms.

Chusme is a community-powered platform to message, plan, fund, and grow — without ads, algorithms, or fear of being shut down.

We help groups unlock tools, coordinate with their members, and sustain themselves collectively.

## Why Chusme?

Organizers everywhere are frustrated:

- Facebook deletes groups with no warning  
- Slack is built for companies, not communities  
- WhatsApp floods conversations with no structure  
- Surveillance platforms monetize every message

**Chusme is different.**  
We give you control, privacy, and a community fund you govern together.

## How It Works

1. **Start a space** — name your group, invite members  
2. **Coordinate** — chat, organize events, broadcast updates  
3. **Unlock tools** — video, usernames, hosting, and more  
4. **Contribute what you can** — toward shared features or community needs  
5. **Decide together** — vote on proposals like paying moderators or funding translators

## Unlock Tools, Fund People

Chusme is free to use — and powered by voluntary contributions.  
Your group can chip in to unlock tools like:

- 📹 Private video hosting  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Custom usernames  
- 🌐 Public websites  
- 🎛️ Enhanced moderation & polls

Any extra money stays with your group — and you choose how to spend it.
