    <h1>Use Cases</h1>

    <p>Chusme is being co-designed with a wide range of community organizers who are testing it in early pilot phases. These collaborators are helping shape every part of the platform — from onboarding flows to moderation systems, from privacy features to fundraising tools.</p>

    <p>They're not just early adopters.<br>
    They're co-creators of the digital infrastructure they want to use.</p>
