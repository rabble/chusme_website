    <h1>Contribute to Holis</h1>
    
    <p>Holis isn't a startup.<br>
    It's a commons ‚Äî built with and for the organizers who use it.</p>
    
    <p>You can contribute by sharing feedback, funding your group's tools, helping improve the code, or running infrastructure to support others. Every contribution strengthens the ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Organizers: Help Shape the Platform</h2>
    
    <p>We're building Holis in close collaboration with mutual aid groups, tenant unions, cultural collectives, indigenous organizers, and volunteer communities.</p>
    
    <p>You can contribute by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Giving feedback on features, flows, and language</li>
      <li>Helping design onboarding experiences for real-world groups</li>
      <li>Co-writing community guides and norms templates</li>
      <li>Running workshops or interviews to gather insight from your network</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This isn't just "user feedback" ‚Äî it's co-design. We build what organizers ask for, not what a product team imagines.</p>

    <h2>üí∏ Financial Contributions</h2>
    
    <p>Holis is free to use.<br>
    But like a community radio station or food coop, we rely on voluntary contributions to sustain it.</p>
    
    <p>You can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contribute personally to Holis's core development</li>
      <li>Donate to your group's community fund</li>
      <li>Help unlock features like video hosting, public websites, or encrypted tools</li>
      <li>Fund moderators, interpreters, facilitators, and group leaders</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Every group on Holis manages its own fund ‚Äî and decides how to spend it together.</p>

    <h2>üåê Host a Relay or Mirror</h2>
    
    <p>Holis uses <a href="https://nostr.com">Nostr</a> ‚Äî an open protocol for distributed communication.</p>
    
    <p>This means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your group can be mirrored across multiple relays</li>
      <li>You can host your own relay to control data and latency</li>
      <li>We don't own your group ‚Äî you do</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you want to host a community relay:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We'll help you get started with open-source tools</li>
      <li>You can serve just your group or many</li>
      <li>You'll be contributing to the resilience of the Holis network</li>
    </ul>
