# Pricing

**Chusme isn't a SaaS product. It's a community-powered platform.**

There's no paywall, no forced upgrade path, and no data monetization.  
Instead, we follow a model rooted in **solidarity, self-governance, and digital privacy**.

Inspired by mutual aid networks, community radio, and tech cooperatives, we believe:

> Everyone contributes what they can — and no one gets left out.

## 💸 How Chusme Groups Fund Themselves

Every group on Chusme has the option to raise funds together.  
You can chip in to unlock tools, build shared infrastructure, and support the people doing the work.

Funds are stored in a **private, community-controlled wallet** — using [Cashu](https://cashu.space), an open-source, privacy-preserving ecash protocol.

---

## 🔐 Why Cashu?

Cashu gives your group:

- ⚡️ Fast, anonymous payments  
- 🏦 A shared group wallet — no bank needed  
- 🔄 Option to exchange for **Bitcoin Lightning** or local currencies  
- 🕵️‍♀️ No tracking, no account IDs, no blockchain surveillance

There's:
- ❌ No token
- ❌ No mining
- ❌ No speculative "web3" risk

Just **real, usable money** — owned by your community, not by a platform.

## 🤲 Voluntary, Not Mandatory

You don't have to pay to join or keep using Chusme.

**If your community hosts your own relay, name server, and media server, you don't need to pay for any Chusme services.** This is permissionless, free software — own your infrastructure, own your community.

But if you believe in building alternatives to Big Tech —
if you want to support moderators, translators, and care workers —
if you want to fund tools that serve movements instead of metrics...

Then this solidarity model is for you.

## 🛠 What You're Funding

Your contributions support:
- The features your group unlocks
- Your own group's community fund (e.g. pay a steward, buy supplies, translate docs)
- The broader Chusme ecosystem: development, hosting, support

This keeps Chusme:
- Open source  
- Community-driven  
- Free from ads, VCs, and surveillance incentives
