## üë§ Step 2: Create Your Account

You'll be asked to:
- Choose a display name
- Set your profile image (optional)
- Link to your preferred Nostr identity (or auto-generate one)

This identity is portable. It can be used across any Nostr-based app ‚Äî not just Chusme.

---

## üèòÔ∏è Step 3: Create a Community

Start your own group by:
- Naming your community
- Adding a short intro message
- Setting visibility (public, private, or invitation-only)

Every new group comes with:
- A shared feed for threads and updates
- Optional events, asks/offers, and polls
- Access to unlocking tools via group contributions

---

## üîó Step 4: Share Your Custom Invite Link

Invite people via:
- A custom short link (e.g. `app.holis.social/join/mycrew`)
- QR code (great for flyers, events, meetups)
- WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, or email

You can also set:
- Onboarding questions
- A welcome post or guide
- Roles (admin, mod, trusted member)

> **Tip:** Personal invites go a long way. Record a short message or voice memo explaining what the group is for and why it matters.

---

## üí¨ Step 5: Use the Feed & Threads

Every community has:
- A group feed (chronological, not algorithmic)
- Threaded replies
- Reactions for ideas, agreements, flags, or follow-up
- Pinned posts for norms, links, or FAQs

You can also:
- Schedule and announce events
- Set up ask/offer mutual aid threads
- Enable announcements-only mode for broadcasts

---

## üì• Step 6: Direct Messages & Notifications

Each member can:
- Send direct messages (DMs)
- Get notifications for threads they follow
- @mention people in comments or posts
- Subscribe to important threads (e.g. rides, alerts)

We prioritize minimal distraction ‚Äî you control your notification preferences.

---

## üí° Step 7: Cultivate Your Culture

Chusme is not just a chat tool. It's a community platform.

Ways to cultivate your space:
- Rotate community roles like facilitator or greeter
- Use emojis and pinned messages to reinforce culture
- Create threads like: "Introduce yourself," "What are we working on?" "What support do you need this week?"

---

## üí∏ Step 8: Unlock Tools & Share Resources

Groups can crowdfund to unlock premium features like:
- Private video storage
- Custom usernames (like `@sofia@mygroup.chusme.social`)
- Public websites or join portals
- Voting and proposal tools

Any extra funds stay with the group. You decide together how to spend them: pay a mod, translate onboarding materials, or support a member in need.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 9: Stay Flexible

Chusme is built on [Nostr](https://nostr.com), a decentralized protocol. That means:
- You can migrate to another server or app
- You can self-host if desired
- You can integrate with other Nostr-based tools over time

Chusme is a gateway ‚Äî not a gatekeeper.
