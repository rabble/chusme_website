# Use Cases

Chusme is being co-designed with a wide range of community organizers who are testing it in early pilot phases. These collaborators are helping shape every part of the platform ‚Äî from onboarding flows to moderation systems, from privacy features to fundraising tools.

They're not just early adopters.  
They're co-creators of the digital infrastructure they want to use.

## Who We're Building With

### üèòÔ∏è Tenant Organizers & Housing Justice Networks

We're working with tenant organizers developing secure communication tools for their networks. Their input is helping us create:

- Encrypted group coordination channels  
- Emergency alerts (like eviction defense mobilizations)  
- Decision-making tools for campaign planning  
- Transparent management of pooled community funds

---

### ü§ù Mutual Aid Groups & Volunteer Collectives

From local mutual aid pods to regional relief efforts, we're learning from groups that coordinate:

- Deliveries and ride shares  
- Needs requests and offers of support  
- Shared ledgers for accountability  
- Rotating stewardship models and non-hierarchical facilitation

Their needs are helping us prioritize clear message threading, norms enforcement, and group-owned financial tools.

### üéõÔ∏è Cultural Creatives & Event Organizers

We're co-designing with artists and event crews organizing everything from community raves to storytelling festivals. These groups need:

- Real-time event coordination across roles  
- RSVP and reminder tools  
- Shared scheduling and venue communication  
- Non-corporate ways to stay in touch after the event

They're pushing us to make Chusme feel more like a party, not a productivity suite ‚Äî but with real structure under the hood.

### üå± Indigenous & Cultural Stewardship Networks

We're collaborating with cultural leaders and indigenous digital stewards who are looking for:

- Safer alternatives to commercial messaging apps  
- Tools that support intergenerational communication  
- Digital infrastructure that aligns with their governance values  
- The option to host and own their own data

Their involvement is shaping how Chusme supports privacy, consent, cultural safety, and community sovereignty.

### üê¥ Large Online Communities Looking for Autonomy

Some of our co-designers run massive online spaces ‚Äî interest-based or geographically rooted groups ‚Äî that have been threatened or erased by platform takedowns.

They're helping us build:
- Moderation tools that scale without centralization  
- User-controlled visibility for posts and updates  
- Familiar-feeling spaces that are actually owned by the community

---

## Built With Organizers, Not Just For Them

These use cases aren't hypothetical ‚Äî they come from real-world organizers who are helping us test and shape Chusme in live pilot environments.

We're still in early development and learning fast.
