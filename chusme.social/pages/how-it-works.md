# How Chusme Works

Chusme is a messaging and coordination platform for communities — built on [Nostr](https://nostr.com/), a decentralized protocol that gives you portability, privacy, and shared control.

It's like email, but for groups.  
It's like WordPress, but for social organizing.  
You can use our app — or run your own. You're never locked in.

## Start a Space

Anyone can start a Chusme space. All you need is:

- A name for your group
- A group bio and welcome message
- Invite links for your community members

Each space gets:
- A private discussion feed
- Optional broadcast-only channels
- A group fund for contributions
- Tools to post updates, events, documents, and more

---

## Invite and Onboard

Once your group is live, you can:

- Share a join link via text, email, QR, or WhatsApp  
- Choose whether your space is open or invite-only  
- Ask onboarding questions (like "where are you based?" or "how do you want to contribute?")

Chusme supports both informal hangouts and high-trust, role-based collaboration.

---

## Coordinate Together

Every Chusme group gets:

- 📣 Message boards (chat + threaded replies)
- 📆 Events with RSVP and follow-up
- 🧭 Broadcast announcements
- ✅ Member-driven moderation
- 📂 Shared documents and media

Use it like:
- A signal-boost channel
- A mutual aid board
- A local union backchannel
- A decentralized help desk

## Unlock the Tools You Need

Chusme is free to use — but you can **crowdfund to unlock extra tools**:

| Feature | Example Use |
|--------|--------------|
| 📹 Video hosting | Share training or event replays |
| 🧑‍💼 Custom usernames | Create identities like `@sofia@mygroup.chusme.social` |
| 🌐 Public website | Publish updates or join pages |
| 🗳️ Proposal voting | Decide how to spend pooled funds |
| 📊 Analytics | See what's working in your community |

> Any extra funds stay with your group — and you decide how to use them.

---

## Contribute and Decide Together

Each group has its own **community fund**.

- Members can chip in monthly or as-needed
- Money goes first to unlock tools
- Leftover funds can pay organizers, support members, or fund events

Groups decide how to use funds using:
- Quick emoji reactions
- Structured Loomio-style voting
- Custom decision rules (you choose!)

---

## Built on Open Protocols

Chusme uses [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr), a decentralized messaging protocol. That means:

- 🛠️ Your group isn't trapped in our app  
- 📨 You can migrate to another server, or host your own  
- 🔗 Your group's messages, members, and identity live on-chain  
- 🏛️ It's like email or WordPress — but for community platforms

**If we disappear, your community doesn't.**

---

## Strong Privacy, Optional Encryption

Chusme offers:

- 🔐 End-to-end encryption (E2EE) for 1:1 messages  
- 🫂 Group message encryption (Signal-style) for trusted groups  
- 🕵️ Metadata minimization: we don't track who you talk to, when, or why  
- 🚫 No ads, no surveillance, no third-party analytics

You can choose:
- Fully open discussion (like a forum)
- Private groups with onboarding gates
- Locked-down encrypted coordination zones

Perfect for:
- Protest organizing  
- Legal aid groups  
- Youth and family services  
- Indigenous or sovereign spaces

---

## Built for the Long Haul

- Open source  
- Interoperable with other Nostr apps  
- Self-hostable  
- Designed for migration, autonomy, and resilience

Whether you're organizing for a season or a decade, Chusme gives you tools that **don't disappear when the platform changes hands**.
