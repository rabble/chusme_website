# Design Principles

"Abstract guiding concepts that can shape Plur's development while still being grounded in real community steward experiences".

## 1. Community Before Scale

Communities thrive when they prioritize depth of connection over rapid growth. The goal of Plur should not be just maximizing user numbers but fostering meaningful engagement. As seen in Cressida's equestrian group, maintaining high standards of behavior led to a more supportive space—even at the cost of removing members​.

→ Design for strong community cultures, not just audience growth.

## 2. Stewardship, Not Just Moderation

Healthy communities require active care, not just content policing. AI-driven moderation, like Facebook's AI Assist, has shown that automating enforcement without human context can backfire​. Community leaders act as stewards, guiding norms and fostering participation.

→ Empower community leaders with tools that help them shape, not just police, discussions.

## 3. Ownership and Stability Over Virality

Social platforms often prioritize short-term engagement (likes, comments, trends) over long-term community resilience. Many community leaders, like Cressida and Josh, have struggled with platform volatility, unexpected shutdowns, and algorithm shifts​​.

→ Build for longevity, ensuring communities can persist and evolve beyond algorithmic whims.

## 4. Participation is a Spectrum

Not all members engage in the same way—some lurk, some contribute occasionally, and some lead. Many platforms fail by focusing only on active users, leaving passive participants behind. Communities like Women Who Code found that informal interactions (e.g., icebreaker bots) helped passive members stay engaged​.

→ Design for multiple levels of participation, from quiet observers to active organizers.

## 5. Make Contribution Frictionless

Communities often struggle with siloed financial transactions, unclear pathways to contribute, and reliance on external payment platforms​​. Whether it's monetary contributions, event RSVPs, or skill-sharing, reducing friction makes generosity easier.

→ Foster a culture of giving by making contribution effortless, whether financial or social.

## 6. Conversation Should Be Navigable, Not Ephemeral

Many current platforms treat discussion as fleeting streams (WhatsApp, Slack, Telegram), making it hard to find important past conversations. Community leaders like Rachel struggled with vanishing or buried posts on Facebook​.

→ Design for lasting, searchable, and structured conversations, not just fleeting updates.

## 7. Rituals Create Belonging

Successful communities develop repeated, meaningful interactions—from weekly check-ins to annual events. Groups like Juliette's birthday club and the Space Cowboys rave community built strong bonds through rituals that sustain engagement​​.

→ Create spaces where communities can develop traditions that reinforce their identity.

## 8. Digital Spaces Should Support Real-World Connection

Online interactions should not replace, but strengthen real-world relationships. Whether it's local neighborhood groups, activist movements, or industry meetups, many stewards use digital tools as a bridge to offline events​​.

→ Design digital tools that facilitate real-life impact, from small meetups to global activism.

## 9. Accessibility is More Than Usability

Communities exist across different cultures, languages, internet speeds, and tech literacy levels. Tools need to be simple enough for casual users yet powerful for advanced organizers. Community leaders like Kaye-Maree emphasized the need for low-barrier, mobile-first solutions that work even in rural areas​.

→ Prioritize inclusivity in technology, ensuring it works for both digital natives and those with limited tech access.

# Non-Negotiables

Based on extensive community steward research, the non-negotiable elements of Plur should align with the core values, needs, and frustrations expressed by community leaders. These elements ensure that Plur respects user agency, fosters trust, and enables meaningful connections.

## 1. Data Sovereignty & Platform Resilience ("We need to own our community, not be at the mercy of a platform")

**Why?** Many community leaders have faced unexpected bans, content loss, and algorithmic changes (Cressida's group was deleted without warning​, Josh Kramer struggled with FB's shifting content visibility​).

**Non-Negotiable Elements:**
- Portable data: Communities should be able to export their data (member lists, content, event history).
- Platform redundancy: Communities should not cease to exist if a third party (e.g., Facebook, Discord) decides to shut them down.
- Custom domains/branding: Ability for communities to brand their space to reinforce identity and independence.

## 2. End-to-End Encryption & Privacy First Architecture ("We can't afford to have our conversations monitored or exploited")

**Why?** Activist communities, decentralized organizers, and even casual community stewards face deplatforming, harassment, or surveillance concerns (Priscilla was deplatformed from Airbnb and Chase​, Rhodes emphasized encrypted chat needs for KC Tenants​).

**Non-Negotiable Elements:**
- End-to-end encryption (E2EE): All messages, voice/video calls, and private group chats must be encrypted by default.
- Decentralized or federated infrastructure: Reduce reliance on a single point of failure.
- Minimal data retention: No unnecessary metadata tracking; ephemeral storage options for sensitive conversations.

## 3. Community-First Moderation & Governance Tools ("We need to be in control of how our community operates")

**Why?** Existing moderation tools are often either too restrictive (AI moderation misfires, sudden bans) or too lax (toxic behavior goes unchecked) (Rachel found Facebook's moderation tools unreliable​, Josh wanted more contextual moderation tools​).

**Non-Negotiable Elements:**
- Community-defined rules & enforcement: Leaders must set and enforce their own moderation standards, without platform interference.
- Flexible moderation levels: Options for human review, automated flagging, and AI assistance—but no mandatory AI policing.
- Appeal process & transparency: Members should have visibility into why they were warned, muted, or banned.

## 4. Multi-Tiered Participation & Role Management ("Not everyone engages the same way")

**Why?** Communities contain lurkers, contributors, organizers, and leaders—a single engagement model doesn't work (Women Who Code used structured roles​, Maggie Shapiro's paid community had clear tiers​).

**Non-Negotiable Elements:**
- Flexible access control: Ability to define public, private, and semi-private spaces.
- Custom roles & permissions: Leaders should assign moderators, contributors, and passive observers.
- Anonymous & pseudonymous participation: To allow for safer engagement, particularly for marginalized groups.

## 5. Asynchronous & Real-Time Communication Options ("Not every conversation needs to happen in the moment")

**Why?** Many communities struggle with keeping discussions findable and structured—chat-based tools like WhatsApp and Slack create chaotic, hard-to-follow threads (Rachel couldn't find old posts​, Benjamin found real-time discussions overwhelming​).

**Non-Negotiable Elements:**
- Persistent, thread-based discussions: Topics should be searchable and navigable, not just disappearing into a scroll.
- Live chat & voice options: For spontaneous conversations and events, akin to Discord's drop-in voice rooms​.
- Event & meeting scheduling: Integrated calendar, RSVPs, and reminders—no need for external tools.

## 6. Financial Tools That Empower Community Growth ("Monetization should be built-in, not hacked together")

**Why?** Community leaders struggle with donations, memberships, and event fees, often using fragmented payment apps (Borja had issues with Bizum & PayPal​, Rachel relied on Kajabi for payments​).

**Non-Negotiable Elements:**
- Built-in donations & micropayments: A way for members to support the community with one click.
- Event ticketing & memberships: Recurring subscriptions, pay-what-you-can models, and one-time payments.
- Revenue transparency & compliance: Clearly track who paid what, with minimal tax/accounting burdens.

## 7. Discoverability Without Algorithmic Manipulation ("We need visibility without being forced into engagement traps")

**Why?** Algorithm-driven feeds often suppress important posts and amplify controversy (Cressida's group posts vanished​, Josh found Facebook's ranking system misaligned​).

**Non-Negotiable Elements:**
- Chronological + pinned content options: Communities should choose whether posts are ranked by engagement or recency.
- Topic & tag-based organization: Members should be able to find past discussions without endless scrolling.
- No engagement farming mechanics: Avoid like/share baiting, click-through prioritization, or forced notifications.

## 8. Interoperability & Open Ecosystem ("We shouldn't be locked into one ecosystem")

**Why?** Community leaders use multiple tools (Slack, Discord, Meetup, WhatsApp, Notion, Airtable) and need interoperability, not isolation (Dae Melchi needed event-sharing across platforms​, Maggie had a fragmented system across Slack & Notion​).

**Non-Negotiable Elements:**
- API & integrations: Support for Zapier, webhooks, or direct integrations with other community tools.
- Federated identity options: Let users sign in with existing credentials (Mastodon, Matrix, Web3 wallets, email/password).
- Exportability & backups: No vendor lock-in—communities should be able to move to another platform if needed.

## Conclusion: What Plur Must Guarantee

At its core, Plur should be community-owned, privacy-first, and adaptable. The non-negotiables are about giving control back to community leaders while ensuring privacy, sustainability, and resilience.
