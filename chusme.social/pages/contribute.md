# Contribute to Chusme

Chusme isn't a startup.  
It's a commons ‚Äî built with and for the organizers who use it.

You can contribute by sharing feedback, funding your group's tools, helping improve the code, or running infrastructure to support others. Every contribution strengthens the ecosystem.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Organizers: Help Shape the Platform

We're building Chusme in close collaboration with mutual aid groups, tenant unions, cultural collectives, indigenous organizers, and volunteer communities.

You can contribute by:
- Giving feedback on features, flows, and language
- Helping design onboarding experiences for real-world groups
- Co-writing community guides and norms templates
- Running workshops or interviews to gather insight from your network

This isn't just "user feedback" ‚Äî it's co-design. We build what organizers ask for, not what a product team imagines.

## üí∏ Financial Contributions

Chusme is free to use.  
But like a community radio station or food coop, we rely on voluntary contributions to sustain it.

You can:
- Contribute personally to Chusme's core development
- Donate to your group's community fund
- Help unlock features like video hosting, public websites, or encrypted tools
- Fund moderators, interpreters, facilitators, and group leaders

Every group on Chusme manages its own fund ‚Äî and decides how to spend it together.

## üåê Host a Relay or Mirror

Chusme uses [Nostr](https://nostr.com) ‚Äî an open protocol for distributed communication.

This means:
- Your group can be mirrored across multiple relays
- You can host your own relay to control data and latency
- We don't own your group ‚Äî you do

If you want to host a community relay:
- We'll help you get started with open-source tools
- You can serve just your group or many
- You'll be contributing to the resilience of the Chusme network
