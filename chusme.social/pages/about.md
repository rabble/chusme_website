# About Chusme

**Chusme is a platform for community organizers** — built on open protocols, sustained by community contributions, and grounded in collective values. We offer groups the tools to coordinate, communicate, and grow — without relying on extractive, ad-driven platforms like Facebook or Slack.

We're here for the communities that build real things — and need real infrastructure to support them.

## Vision

To empower communities to **organize, communicate, and fund themselves** on their own terms — with **privacy**, **security**, and **digital sovereignty** at the core.

We believe in a future where:
- Communities govern their own digital spaces
- Technology reflects the values of mutual aid and solidarity
- Infrastructure is collectively owned — not leased from billionaires

## Our Roots

Chusme is one part of a broader ecosystem of community tech, shaped by years of work in decentralized social platforms and community organizing. We're built by the same team behind:

- [**Nos Social**](https://nos.social/about) — A simple, ad-free social app that connects people over the Nostr protocol. Nos is a starting point for a fully open and decentralized social web, where your identity and data are portable and controlled by you.

- [**Verse PBC**](https://verse-pbc.org) — A Public Benefit Corporation that builds resilient, public-interest infrastructure for community-owned apps. Verse supports projects like Chusme with a focus on care, transparency, and protocol-first architecture.

- [**Rights.social**](https://rights.social) — A manifesto and framework for digital self-determination. We believe that online communities deserve rights just like physical ones — including the right to free association, data ownership, and algorithmic transparency.

- [**Planetary**](https://planetary.social) — A decentralized social network that runs on the Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB) protocol. Planetary helped pioneer humane tech for creators, activists, and small communities — without surveillance or platform lock-in.

These projects share one thread: **technology that centers people, not platforms.**

## Our Approach

We design Chusme using the following principles:

- **User Ownership**  
  Your data, relationships, and group identity should always belong to you.

- **Decentralization by Default**  
  We build on protocols like [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) so that no one — not even us — can unilaterally control your community.

- **Community Governance**  
  Each group on Chusme sets its own norms, moderation flows, and decision-making models. Inspired by tools like [Loomio](https://www.loomio.com), not top-down feeds.

- **Transparency & Openness**  
  Chusme is open source. We publish roadmaps and welcome contributors who want to shape the direction of the platform.

## Join Us

Chusme isn't just a product — it's a commons.

We're building a future where:
- Neighborhood groups don't disappear when Facebook changes the rules
- Activists can coordinate securely and privately
- Garden clubs and protest networks alike can own their digital infrastructure

**We invite organizers, developers, and communities to build this future with us.**
